## Safe Quantum Programs Execution

To run the transpiler of Qiskit, the python code needs to be executed, thus we need a safe environment to execute them without causing harm, since the code is generated by a model we cannot trust it.

1. Install Docker [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
1. Follow the instructions to allow the non-root user to run Docker [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/).
1. Create a Docker image with the qiskit version we need, from the root repo.
    ```shell
    docker build -t qiskit-driver .
    ```
1. Run a simple python script `Results/qiskit/0.fuzz` inside the docker container.
    ```shell
    docker run -v $(pwd)/Results/qiskit/0.fuzz:/0.fuzz qiskit-driver /0.fuzz
    ```
