qiskit (parser),,1,,,,confirmed,wrong exported QASM,append empty circuit,The QASM2 exporter creates an invalid qasm when an empty circuit is appended.,https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/10435,,
qiskit (parser),,,1,,,confirmed (duplicate + fixed),wrong exported QASM,recursive (self-referencing) gate_QFT,"A circuit where a QFT is appended to a circuit and then exported to QASM, cannot be reimported because it produces an invalid qasm (with a recursive definition of the gate_QFT, not described anywhere).",https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/10468,,
qiskit (parser),,2,,,,confirmed (two bugs in one),wrong exported QASM,barriers with empty list of qubits,"When I append barriers with empty list of target qubits I get no warnings, but then the generated qasm is invalid.",https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/10465,,
qiskit (parser),,1,,,,confirmed,wrong exported QASM,register name clashes with names qelib1.inc,"When I declare a register named with the same name of a gate and then export it in QASM, the exporter generates invalid QASM where the register name clashes with the std gates (due to lack of escaping of the register name).",https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/10459,,
qiskit (parser),1,1,,,,confirmed (fixed in new parser),wrong exported QASM,CREG size must be positive,"In case I declare a circuit by passing 0 as the number of qubits followed by a measure_all, then exported it to QASM; the generated QASM is invalid, containing a creg with size 0.",https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/10460,,
qiskit (optimizer),,1,,,,confirmed,crash in optimization,commutation analysis Cannot apply operation with classical bits: measure,,https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/10470,,
qiskit (optimizer),,,1,,,confirmed (duplicate),crash in optimization,commutation analysis Cannot apply Operation: reset,,https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/10482,,
qiskit (copy),,1,,,,confirmed (general python edge case),crash in optimization,QuantumCircuit.copy(name=?) allows for any object to be used as name,,https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/10487,,
qiskit (optimizer),,1,,,,confirmed (fixing PR ready),crash in optimization,commutation analysis lead to numpy.core._exceptions._ArrayMemoryError with large mct #10488,,https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/10488,,
qiskit (transpiler),,,,1,,,crash in transpiler ,Transpiler: for_loop (even with static loops) cannot be (directly) transpiled,"Transpiling a circuit with a for_loop (with statically known amount of loops) as described here leads to a an error: qiskit.transpiler.exceptions.TranspilerError: ""The control-flow construct 'for_loop' is not supported by the backend."" error.",https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/10501,,
qiskit (exporter),,,1,,,"confirmed (duplicate, thus not filed)",wrong exported QASM,Exporting a circuit with `initialize()` in QASM2 leads to invalid qasm with `reset`.,,https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/8048,,
qiskit (exporter),,,1,,,"confirmed (duplicate, filed in the same old bug as reinforcement)",wrong exported QASM,"Exporting a circuit with a sub-circuit via `append()` and that uses `measure()` leads to an invalid qasm file, generating error when imported again.",,https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/7750#issuecomment-1653252574,,
