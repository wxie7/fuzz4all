The Rust standard library (`std`) provides developers with a wide range of core functionalities, including basic data types, collections, concurrency, I/O operations, and more.

The Rust standard library is structured as follows:
Primitive Types and Data Structures: Includes numeric types, strings, arrays, slices, and more.
Collections: Includes `Vec`, `HashMap`, `HashSet`, and other collection types.
Error Handling: Features such as `Result` and `Option`.
Concurrency and Synchronization: Thread management, channels, mutexes, and more.
Input/Output Operations: For file handling, network communication, etc.
System-Related Modules: Provides functionality for interacting with the operating system, such as environment variables, process control, and more.

System-Related Modules

`std::fs` - File System Operations

This module provides functionality for creating, reading, writing, and traversing files and directories.

Key Types and Functions:
`File`: Represents a file for reading or writing.
`OpenOptions`: Configures how a file is opened.
`read_to_string`, `write`: Functions for reading from or writing to a file.
`create_dir`, `remove_dir`: Functions for creating or removing directories.
`read_dir`: Allows directory traversal.

`std::env` - Environment Variables and Arguments

This module allows access to environment variables and command-line arguments.

Key Functions
`args`, `args_os`: Functions for retrieving command-line arguments.
`var`, `set_var`: Functions for getting or setting environment variables.
`current_dir`, `set_current_dir`: Functions for getting or setting the current working directory.
`home_dir`: Function to retrieve the user's home directory (may require additional crates for full support).

`std::process` - Process Control

This module is used to create and manage child processes, and to execute system commands.

Key Types and Functions
`Command`: Constructs and configures new processes.
`Child`: Represents a handle to a child process.
`exit`: Exits the current process with a specified status code.
`id`: Retrieves the unique identifier of the current process.

`std::thread` - Multithreading

This module provides functionality for creating and managing threads.

Key Types and Functions:
`spawn`: Spawns a new thread.
`Thread`: Represents a handle to a thread.
`sleep`: Puts the current thread to sleep for a specified duration.

`std::sync` - Synchronization Primitives

This module provides data structures for sharing data and synchronizing between threads.

Key Types:
`Mutex`: A mutual exclusion lock for protecting shared data.
`RwLock`: A read-write lock that allows multiple readers or exclusive writers.
`Arc`: An atomically reference-counted pointer for shared ownership across threads.

`std::net` - Networking

This module provides functionality for network communication over TCP and UDP protocols.

Key Types:
`TcpListener`, `TcpStream`: Used for TCP connections.
`UdpSocket`: Used for UDP communication.
`IpAddr`, `SocketAddr`: Represent IP addresses and socket addresses.

`std::time` - Time Handling

This module provides functionality for handling system time and durations.

Key Types:
`Instant`: Represents a specific point in time, useful for measuring time intervals.
`SystemTime`: Represents system time, which can be earlier or later than `UNIX_EPOCH`.
`Duration`: Represents a span of time.
