Changes integrated into the latest working draft of C23 are listed below.[4]

Standard Library
New functions
add memset_explicit() function in <string.h> to erase sensitive data, where memory store must always be performed regardless of optimizations.[6]
add memccpy() function in <string.h> to efficiently concatenate strings - similar to POSIX and SVID C extensions.[7]
add strdup() and strndup() functions in <string.h> to allocate a copy of a string â€“ similar to POSIX and SVID C extensions.[8]
add memalignment() function in <stdlib.h> to determine the byte alignment of a pointer.[9]
add bit utility functions / macros / types in new header <stdbit.h> to examine many integer types. All start with stdc_ to minimize conflict with legacy code and 3rd party libraries.[10]
In the following, replace * with uc, us, ui, ul, ull for five function names, or blank for a type-generic macro.[10]
add stdc_count_ones*() and stdc_count_zeros*() to count number of 1 or 0 bits in value.[10]
add stdc_leading_ones*() and stdc_leading_zeros*() to count leading 1 or 0 bits in value.[10]
add stdc_trailing_ones*() and stdc_trailing_zeros*() to count trailing 1 or 0 bits in value.[10]
add stdc_first_leading_one*() and stdc_first_leading_zero*() to find first leading bit with 1 or 0 in value.[10]
add stdc_first_trailing_one*() and stdc_first_trailing_zero*() to find first trailing bit with 1 or 0 in value.[10]
add stdc_has_single_bit*() to determine if value an exact power of 2 (return true if and only if there is a single 1 bit).[10]
add stdc_bit_floor*() to determine the largest integral power of 2 that is not greater than value.[10]
add stdc_bit_ceil*() to determine the smallest integral power of 2 that is not less than value.[10]
add stdc_bit_width*() to determine number of bits to represent a value.[10]
add timegm() function in <time.h> to convert time structure into calendar time value - similar to function in glibc and musl libraries.[11]
Existing functions
add %b binary conversion specifier to printf() function family, prepending non-zero values with 0b, similar to how %x works. Implementations that previously didn't use %B as their own extension are encouraged to implement and prepend non-zero values with 0B, similar to how %X works.[12]
add %b binary conversion specifier to scanf() function family.[12]
add 0b and 0B binary conversion support to strtol() and wcstol() function families.[12]
make the functions bsearch(), bsearch_s(), memchr(), strchr(), strpbrk(), strrchr(), strstr(), and their wide counterparts wmemchr(), wcschr(), wcspbrk(), wcsrchr(), wcsstr() return a const qualified object if one was passed to them.[13]
Preprocessor
add #elifdef and #elifndef directives[14] are essentially equivalent to #elif defined and #elif !defined. Both directives were added to C++23 standard and GCC 12 compiler too.[15]
add #embed directive for binary resource inclusion and __has_embed allowing the availability of a resource to be checked by preprocessor directives.[16]
add #warning directive for diagnostics.[17]
add __has_include allowing the availability of a header to be checked by preprocessor directives.[18]
add __has_c_attribute allowing the availability of an attribute to be checked by preprocessor directives.[19] (see "C++ compatibility" group for new attribute feature)
add __VA_OPT__ functional macro for variadic macros which expands to its argument only if a variadic argument has been passed to the containing macro.[20]
Types
add nullptr_t, a null pointer type.[21]
add _BitInt(N) and unsigned _BitInt(N) types for bit-precise integers. Add BITINT_MAXWIDTH macro for maximum bit width.[22][23] Add ckd_add(), ckd_sub(), ckd_mul() macros for checked integer operations.[24]
Variably-modified types (but not VLAs which are automatic variables allocated on the stack) become a mandatory feature.[25]
Better support for using const with arrays.[26]
Standardization of the typeof(...) operator.[27]
the meaning of the auto keyword was changed to cause type inference while also retaining its old meaning of a storage class specifier if used alongside a type. Unlike C++, C23 allows type inference only for object definitions (no inferring function return type or function parameter type).[28]
compatibility rules for structure, union, and enumerated types were changed to allow a redeclaration of a compatible type with the same tag.[29]
Constants
add nullptr constant for nullptr_t type.[21]
add wb and uwb integer literal suffixes for _BitInt(N) and unsigned _BitInt(N) types,[30] such as 6uwb yields an unsigned _BitInt(3), and -6wb yields a signed _BitInt(4) which has three value bits and one sign bit.
add 0b and 0B binary literal constant prefixes,[31] such as 0b10101010 (equating to 0xAA).
add ' digit separator to literal constants,[32] such as 0xFE'DC'BA'98 (equating to 0xFEDCBA98), 299'792'458 (equating to 299792458), 1.414'213'562 (equating to 1.414213562).
add the ability to specify the underlying type of an enum.[33]
allow enums with no fixed underlying type to store values that aren't representable by int.[34]
Keywords
add true and false keywords.[35]
add alignas, alignof, bool, static_assert, thread_local keywords. Previously defined keywords become alternative spellings: _Alignas, _Alignof, _Bool, _Static_assert, _Thread_local.[36]
add _BitInt keyword (see "types" group)
add typeof and typeof_unqual keywords (see "types" group)
add nullptr keyword (see "constants" group)
add constexpr keyword (see "other" group)
add _Decimal32, _Decimal64, _Decimal128 keywords for (optional) decimal floating-point arithmetic (see "other" group)
Syntax
Labels can appear before declarations and at the end of compound statements.[37]
Unnamed parameters in function definitions.[38]
Zero initialization with {} (including initialization of VLAs).[39]
variadic functions no longer need a named argument before the ellipsis and the va_start macro no longer needs a second argument nor does it evaluate any argument after the first one if present.[40]
add C++11 style attribute syntax[41] using double square brackets [[]].
add single-argument _Static_assert for compatibility with C++17.[42]
functions with no arguments listed in the prototype void foo() are understood as taking no arguments (see removal of K&R function declarations)
Other features
Support for the ISO/IEC 60559:2020, the current version of the IEEE 754 standard for floating-point arithmetic, with extended binary floating-point arithmetic and (optional) decimal floating-point arithmetic.[53][54]
The constexpr specifier for objects but not functions, unlike C++'s equivalent.[55]
add char8_t type for storing UTF-8 encoded data and change the type of u8 character constants and string literals to char8_t. Also, the functions mbrtoc8() and c8rtomb() to convert a narrow multibyte character to UTF-8 encoding and a single code point from UTF-8 to a narrow multibyte character representation respectively.[56]
clarify that all char16_t strings and literals shall be UTF-16 encoded, and all char32_t strings and literals shall be UTF-32 encoded, unless otherwise explicitly specified.[57]
allow storage class specifiers to appear in compound literal definition.[58]
