In the absence of face-to-face WG21 meetings during the COVID pandemic, few new features were added to the C++23 draft in early standards meetings. The following were added after the virtual WG21 meeting of 9 November 2020, where they were approved by straw polls:[7]

A member function contains for std::basic_string and std::basic_string_view, to check whether or not the string contains a given substring or character[9]
A stacktrace library (<stacktrace>), based on Boost.Stacktrace[10]
A type trait std::is_scoped_enum[11]
The header <stdatomic.h>, for interoperability with C atomics[12]

After the autumn 2021 ISO C++ standards plenary virtual meeting of October 2021, new features and defect reports were approved by straw polls:[39]

Non-literal variables, labels, and gotos in constexpr functions, but still ill-formed to evaluate them at compile-time.[40]
Explicit this object parameter.[41]
Changes on character sets and encodings.[42][43]
New preprocessors: #elifdef and #elifndef.[44] Both directives were added to C23 (C language update) and GCC 12.[45]
Allowing alias declarations in init-statement.[46]
Overloading multidimensional subscript operator (e.g. arr[1, 2]).[47]
Decay copy in language: auto(x) or auto{x}.[48]
Changes in text formatting library:
Fixing locale handling in chrono formatters.[49]
Use of forwarding references in format arguments to allow std::generator-like types.[50]
Addition of type alias std::pmr::stacktrace which is equivalent to std::basic_stacktrace<std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator>.[51]
Changes in ranges library:
Refined definition of a view.[52]
Replacing function template std::ranges::istream_view with alias templates std::ranges::istream_view, std::ranges::wistream_view, and customization point object std::views::istream.[53]
zip range adaptor family:[54]
zip_view
zip_transform_view
adjacent_view (and std::views::pairwise being equivalent to std::views::adjacent<2>)
adjacent_transform_view (and std::views::pairwise_transform being equivalent to std::views::adjacent_transform<2>)
std::move_only_function.[55]
Monadic operations for std::optional.[56]
Member function template std::basic_string::resize_and_overwrite.[57]

Every specialization of std::span and std::basic_string_view is trivially copyable.[61]
Adding conditional noexcept specifications to std::exchange.[62]
Revamped specification and use of integer-class types.[63]
Clarify C headers. "The headers are not useful in code that is only required to be valid C++. Therefore, the C headers should be provided by the C++ standard library as a fully-supported, not deprecated part, but they should also be discouraged for use in code that is not polyglot interoperability code. [..] This proposal makes the C headers no longer deprecated, so there is no formal threat of future removal. The effective discouragement to use the C headers in pure C++ code is now spelled out explicitly as normative discouragement."[64]
After the virtual WG21 meeting of 7 February 2022, the following features are added where they were approved by straw polls:[65]

std::expected[66]
constexpr for cmath and cstdlib[67]
Function to mark unreachable code[68]
ranges::to[69]
A type trait to detect reference binding to temporary[70]
Making std::unique_ptr constexpr[71]
Pipe support for user-defined range adaptors[72]
ranges::iota, ranges::shift_left and ranges::shift_right[73]
views::join_with[74]
Windowing range adaptors: views::chunk and views::slide[75]
views::chunk_by[76]
After the virtual WG21 meeting of 25 July 2022, the following features and defect reports are added where they were approved by straw polls:[77]

Made rewriting equality in expressions less of a breaking change.[78]
Reverted the deprecation of bitwise assignment to volatile variables.[79]
Added the #warning preprocessor directive.[80]
Removed non-encodable wide character literals and multicharacter wide character literals.[81]
Allowed labels to appear at the end of compound statements.[82]
Added escape sequences delimited with curly braces for octal and hexadecimal numbers and universal character names.[83]
Allowed constexpr functions to never be constant expressions.[84]
Simplified some implicit move rules from C++20 and allowed implicit move when returning an rvalue reference.[85]
Add a way to specify unicode characters by name. For example, U'\N{LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH MACRON}' // Equivalent to U'\u0100'[86]
Allowed operator operator() to be static.[87]
Allowed the this pointer and references of unknown origin to appear in constant expressions.[88]
Allowed implementations to define extended floating-point types in addition to the three standard floating-point types. Added the type aliases std::float16_t, std::float32_t, std::float64_t, std::float128_t, std::bfloat16_t for these extended types accessible through the header <stdfloat>, their corresponding literal suffixes f16 f32 f64 f128 bf16or F16 F32 F64 F128 BF16 and added overloads to various standard library functions that take floats as arguments.[89]
Added the [[assume(expression)]] attribute which allows the compiler to assume the provided expression is true to allow optimizations.[90]
Made support for UTF-8 source files mandatory, providing a portable encoding for source files.[91]
Allowed arrays of char and unsigned char to be initialized with UTF-8 string literals.[92]
Removed the requirement that wchar_t can encode all characters of the extended character set, in effect allowing UTF-16 to be used for wide string literals.[93]
Added std::mdspan, a multidimensional array view analogous to std::span.[94][95][96][97]
flat_map and flat_set were added to the standard library.[98][99]
Added the std::print and std::println functions for printing formatted text to stdout.[100]
Provide the named modules std and std.compat for importing the standard library.[101]
Added support for exclusive mode fstreams, analogous to the "x" flag in fopen.[102]
Allowed std::format to handle Ranges.[103]
Made std::string::substr use move semantics.[104]
Added std::generator which implements a coroutine generator that models std::ranges::input_range[105]
After the hybrid WG21 meeting of 7 November 2022, the following features and defect reports are added where they were approved by straw polls:[106]

Allowed operator operator[] to be static.[107]
Allowed static and thread_local variables to appear in constexpr functions if they are usable in constant expressions.[108]
consteval propagates upwards, that is, certain existing constexpr functions become consteval functions when those functions can already only be invoked during compile time.[109]
Extended the lifetime of temporaries that appear in the for-range-initializer of a range-based for loop to cover the entire loop.[110]
Monadic functions for std::expected.[111]
Synchronize the output of std::print with the underlying stream if the native Unicode API is used.[112]
Reverted the deprecation of (all, not just bitwise) compound assignment to volatile variables.[113]
Removed and deprecated features
Removed the garbage collection support that was added in C++11, despite many GC implementations available for C++; "Garbage Collection in C++ is clearly useful for particular applications. However, Garbage Collection as specified by the Standard is not useful for those applications."[114]
Deprecate std::aligned_storage and std::aligned_union[115]
